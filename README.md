Through this task, I gained hands-on experience with Nmap for network reconnaissance and port scanning. I learned to identify local IP ranges, perform SYN (-sS) and TCP Connect (-sT) scans, save results, and analyze open ports. This exercise enhanced my understanding of how exposed ports can pose security risks and strengthened my practical skills in basic network security assessment.
Here the steps for complete my task,
Step 1: Install nmap
Step 2: Find the local ip and paste the ip on nmap for scan
Step 3: Edit the profile for TCP SYC
Step 4: Then use scan button
Step 5: Now it shows all details
